The team needs to understand how often customers again phone customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers. 
This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with
# Project goal: Explore trends in repeat callers
# The deliverables and metrics:

A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date
A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type
Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

# Measure success:
The team’s ultimate goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operational optimization. My dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

we use the target table you created to design a BI visualization that will address the Google Fiber customer service team’s questions. As you create your dashboard, complete the steps of the process you’ve learned in this course. Start by creating a mockup, then make your charts, a dashboard, and a brief presentation that summarizes your work. At any time, feel free to review the activities from earlier in this course.
